# flashcards

This project is my attempt at creating a web app with which the user can study their flashcards.

## goal

My main goal in creating this webapp is to learn **correct** practices of development and implement as many (modern) programming concepts as possible, while trying to keep the code clean.

## motivation

As you can see, the project is in its _early_ stages, but hopefully soon I will be able to make something usable out of it!
